What It Is

- An app to earn points called FIT by doing activities and redeem rewards.
- Your balance goes up when you complete activities and goes down when you redeem rewards.
Before You Start

- Open the project page in your browser.
- Connect your wallet (for example, Metamask).
- If the app asks you to switch network, accept.
Earn Points (FIT)

- On the Home page you will see quick activities (Gym, Run, Yoga, Swimming).
- Press the button to mark the activity as done.
- Your balance should increase with the points of that activity.
- Custom activity: write a name and the number of points (between 1 and 100) and press confirm.
Simple Rules

- You cannot set 0 points; minimum is 1.
- You cannot request more than 100 points per activity.
- If you try more than allowed, you will see an error message.
- To redeem a reward, you need enough points.
Redeem Rewards

- Go to the rewards page.
- You will see several options (for example, Pizza, Movie, Coffee, Spa) with their FIT cost.
- If you have enough points, the button will be available.
- Press “Redeem” and confirm. Your balance will decrease according to the cost.
Full Test (Step By Step)

- Connect your wallet on the website.
- Do “Gym 20 FIT”:
  - Check your balance before.
  - Press the Gym button and confirm.
  - Wait a few seconds and check your balance: it should go up by 20.
- Test the limit:
  - Try to request 150 FIT in a custom activity.
  - It should show an error because the maximum is 100.
- Redeem a reward:
  - If you have 100 or more, redeem “Pizza” (100 FIT).
  - Your balance should drop by 100 after confirming.
What To Expect

- When confirming, your wallet will ask you to accept the action.
- After accepting, wait a few seconds to see the change in your balance.
- If you don’t see changes, reload the page and check again.
If Something Doesn’t Work

- It doesn’t let you redeem: you are missing points.
- Balance doesn’t update: wait 15–30 seconds and reload.
- Network notice appears: press “Switch network” when the app asks.
- Disabled button: you don’t have enough points yet.
Tips

- Read the messages before accepting actions.
- Do not share your wallet keys.
- Make sure you are on the correct project website.
How To Validate (Save Evidence)

- Take a screenshot of your balance before earning points.
- Take another screenshot when confirming the activity in your wallet.
- Take a screenshot of the balance after (it should go up).
- Repeat screenshots before and after redeeming a reward (it should go down).
- If an error appears (for example, requesting more than 100), capture that message.
